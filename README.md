*** Work Flow ***

    requirements.txt and setup.py:
        Create a requirements.txt file listing the project dependencies.
        Optionally, create a setup.py file for packaging and distribution.

    Notebooks:
        Begin your work in Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model development.
        Save and organize your notebooks in a dedicated directory, such as notebooks/.

    Source Code (src):
        Move your code from notebooks to a structured source code directory (e.g., src/).
        Divide the code into modules or scripts for better organization.

    Application Setup (app.py, templates, static):
        Create an app.py file for your Flask application.
        Organize HTML templates in a templates/ directory.
        Place static files (like images or CSS) in a static/ directory.

    Documentation and Version Control:
        Write a comprehensive README.md to document your project, including instructions for running the application and any other relevant information.
        Create a .gitignore file to specify files or directories that should be ignored by version control.
